# LWJGL-test
Basic LWJGL test

Just a simple exercise using LWJGL 3, little use for this outside reference.

#Dependecies:
  LWJGL 3 : Light Weight Java Game Library 3, which you can download <a href="https://www.lwjgl.org/">here</a>. Manually add the JAR and native files to your classpath in order to build and run the game.
