# LWJGL-test
Basic LWJGL test

Just a simple exercise using LWJGL 3, little use for this outside reference.

#Dependecies:
  LWJGL 3 : Light Weight Java Game Library 3, which you can download here. You'll have to manually add the JAR and native files to your     classpath in order to build and run the game.
